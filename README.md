# A CLI built in Node Js for creating File Based Routing for Express Backend

## Features

✓ Suports both TypeScript and JavaScript

✓ Support for any Database or ORM

✓ No need to create routes explicitly for your services, just create a folder and it will automatically becomes the routes

## Usage

Use directly with npx (npx comes installed with npm)

```sh
npx create-router-backend <name-of-your-project>
```

Then you just answer some prompts and _boom!_ you got a backend.

## Examples

Create project named my-backend

the following command will create template within folder my-backend

> $ npx create-backend my-backend

the following command will create template within same folder

> $ npx create-backend . (dot)
